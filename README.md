# SYDE 383 Tank Drainage Model
Physics-based mathematical model for predicting the time it takes for water to drain from a tank through a discharge pipe. The model accounts for major and minor head losses using Bernoulli's equation and is applied to multiple test cases, including variations in pipe length and the use of a T-joint.
